                                Nepal (नेपाल), officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल Sanghiya Loktāntrik Ganatantra Nepāl), is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. Nepal is divided into 7 states and 75 districts and 744 local units including 4 metropolises, 13 sub-metropolises, 246 municipal councils and 481 villages. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. Neither does it border Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains,[14] subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. Nepal is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.

                            The national flag of Nepal is the only triangular flag in the world. The trianglular shape symbolizes the mountains of the country. The flag has two distinct colors red and blue. Crimson red is the color of the national flower, Rhododendron. It symbolizes the blood of the patriots who fought to keep the country sovereign. The blue color symbolizes the peace and harmony among its citizens.

                            The moon is said to symbolize the calming nature of the Nepalese people. While the sun symbolizes fierce resolve. Additionally, the moon is also said to represent the cool temperatures of the mountains and the sun is said to represent the warm nature of the Terai plains.

                    <ul>

                    <li>Nepal opened its borders to the world in the 1950s and 2011 is Nepal Tourism Year! So make this year count and join the celebration!

                    People in Nepal do not greet one another with a handshake, but rather put their palms together and bow their forehead and say Namaste (directly translated as ‘I salute the God in youˇ). This is the same greeting used throughout India.

                    A popular and cheap ‘fast food’ is the Momo. Delicious dumplings made from flour and water filled with different fillings like chicken, meat or vegetables either fried or steamed and served with a dipping sauce. My favorites were the yak-meat filled ones at the Yak CafÃ in Kathmandu.
